Consider the generalized Eight queens problem, i.e., the problem generalized to a chessboard of the size N x N and N queens, for a natural number N. Encode the generalized problem into a propositional formula that is satisfiable iff (if and only if) the problem has a solution, and a model of the formula encodes the solution. Write a computer program (in a language of your preference, although I suggest to use a scripting language such as Python in order to do it quickly) that outputs a CNF formula encoding the problem. The parameter N should be the single input argument. The CNF formula should be output in the DIMACS format. Use variable numbers for cells in a sequence, starting from the upper left corner, going first to the right and then down. That is, variables number 1 to N represent cells in the first row (left to right), variables number N+1 to 2N represent cells in the second row, etc. See below for N = 8. Use a SAT solver to check whether the formula is satisfiable
